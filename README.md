# LRUCache
LeetCode problem 146 LRU Cache in Java
I liked this problem very much.
My first CS class at Cornell Universiy dealt with queues and other data structures.
For one of the class projects we had to develop a simulation based on queues.
At work I have developed and extensive queue library.
What can I say; I like queues and associated data structures.
